# Goodreads Export to Obsidian Notes

This workflow will convert a single CSV file into separate, interlinked Obsidian notes on macOS using the built-in Shortcuts app, my app Actions for Obsidian, and Sindre Sorhus'es excellent Actions app (no relation).

The example data is a Goodreads book export, and the result is many book notes, many author notes, many “publishing year” notes, and links between them.

CSV file is not included, [please bring your own.](https://help.goodreads.com/s/article/How-do-I-import-or-export-my-books-1553870934590)
