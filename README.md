# Actions for Obsidian Workflow Library

Welcome to the library of downloadable Apple Shortcuts workflows for the [**Actions for Obsidian**](https://actions.work/actions-for-obsidian) macOS & iOS application.

Actions for Obsidian ("AfO") is a helper app that brings the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) note-taking app into Apple's automation ecosystem by adding new actions to the Shortcuts app, for creating, reading, searching and updating your notes and vaults. The workflows in this library are designed around Obsidian using AfO.

For more information about the app, please visit the [**Actions for Obsidian** website](https://actions.work/actions-for-obsidian).
